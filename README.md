# Project | Module 2
## Introduction
This repository is part of the 9-week Data Analytics bootcamp at Ironhack. For this project, I determined which district in Beijing recorded highest concentration of air pollutants and how meteorelogical conditions influence pollutant concentrations.
## Description
The data used in this notebook was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data). The data consists of hourly data of six main air pollutants and six relevant meteorological variables from March 2013 to February 2017 at multiple sites in Beijing.
## Hypotheses 
What are the different meteorological conditions that influence air quality?
